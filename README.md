## Download 😎

There is currently no possibility of directly downloading ready-made apk files. The very idea of downloading unfinished software sounds strange to me.  Please be patient while I finish something working.  And if you can’t stand it, then build the project yourself!

## Build 🐢

Download the **Android Studio** application to your computer or **AndroidIDE** if you do not have it on your mobile phone. Click the clone repository button and enter the link to this repository.  Next, open the project, wait a couple of minutes and then click on the “▶” build button.

## Want to Contribute? 🤝

All contributions are welcome, from code to documentation to graphics to design suggestions to bug reports. Please use GitHub to its fullest; contribute Pull Requests, contribute tutorials or other content - whatever you have to offer, we can use!
